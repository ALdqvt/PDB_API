1. listToIDs.py converts your protein names to PDB IDs by searching for them with their species name on rcsb.org
These IDs are then saved in a .csv for for each corresponding species.

Some downloads may not work, unsure why.
3. SAP_XML.py is meant to convert all downloaded .pdb files in their beta-factor to show their per residue SAP-score.
